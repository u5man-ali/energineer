        <p className="mb-4">Solar panels are no longer a futuristic concept‚Äîthey‚Äôre a mainstream energy solution powering millions of homes worldwide. But with so many types available, how do you choose the right one?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">This comprehensive guide explores the six main types of solar panels, their pros and cons, efficiency ratings, lifespans, and real-world applications. Whether you're a homeowner looking to cut energy bills or a tech enthusiast curious about next-gen solar innovations, this guide has everything you need</p>
        <h3 className="w-full h-min text-body-lg text-neutral-default font-semibold ">1. Monocrystalline Solar Panels: The Gold Standard</h3>
        <h5 className="w-full h-min text-body-md text-neutral-default font-semibold ">What Are They?</h5>
        <p className="mb-4">Monocrystalline panels are made from a single silicon crystal, giving them a sleek black appearance and superior efficiency. They dominate the market, making up 98% of global solar shipments in 2023.</p>
         <p className="mb-4">
          This type of solar panels have a high grade of efficiency ranging between 20-25% (highest among commercial panels). The lifespan of these solar panels is expected to be 30-40 years with an impressive power output range of 500W‚Äì700W under standard testing conditions. This makes them some of the most powerful panels available. The best use case for these solar panels is for homeowners with limited roof space who want maximum efficiency
